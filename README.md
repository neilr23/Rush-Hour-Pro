# Rush Hour Pro

I wanted to apply breadth-first search to a strategy game I typically play. I decided to develop a Rush Hour solver since the game usually contains many difficult puzzles that usually have shorter game paths that are not shared to the public.

The app takes user input for a rush hour puzzle and then instruct the user on how to solve the given puzzle. Each step is shown as a proper game state with its own defined symbols.
